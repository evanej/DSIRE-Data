This folder will contain Jupyter Notebook files with code to work with the DSIRE data
Note that each will likely pull the initial data from my desktop, so part will need to be recoded before someone else can use it


The csv file contains code to filter for the key search terms using the "program" DSIRE CSV file
The "dsire_json_2010_2020_data_v1" file contains code to upload and filter the json file with DSIRE data from January 1, 2010 through July 1, 2020
The "dsire_json_all_data_v1" file contains code to upload and filter the json file with all DSIRE programs
The "dsire_json_original_data_filter_v1" contains code to upload, merge, and filter the three time frame DSIRE files. I do not reccomend using it, the other two options will produce more accurate results
